## Third-party packages

1. Axios
2. AwesomeDebouncePromise
3. Reactstrap
4. Node-sass

### Axios is used to fetch data from the API. I also used interceptors to handle API.

### AwesomeDebouncePromise is a great utility to handle frequent debounce api calls. If it were normal synchronous operations, then i would have written my own debounce function. 

### Reactstrap is used to handle the elements in UI.

### Node-sass is used to write scss in the app. 

### I have used React Hooks instead of class based components.
